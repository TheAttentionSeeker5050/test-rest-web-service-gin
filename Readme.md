# My First Golang Gin Server

# Description

This is just a basic project to get familiarized with golang, I just got started with go and want to get familiarized with the syntax, golang's methodology and the processes, methods and capabilities of Gin before I do more complex projects. The project consist on a Rest API in which you make a request and it calculates a specific mathematical function and returns values based on your input. I may try out other features of gin such as adding web drivers, authentication, permissions and advanced validation, but for now I will just make  API post requests without any auth and get the result on a json response
